# UNIX-Turn-Based-Game

This is my Assembly turnbased multiplayer game that allows for up to 10 players with three different classes with unique attacks and health. This class had a huge focus on Computer register manipulation with moving values around to compare and recieve user input. I learned the true way that the fundamental loops and other statements work behind the scenes and used these to create a functioning game with input validation and randomness.

In the game each class has four different attack all with different accuracy and damage. Every round each player chooses one other player to attack and depending on the accuracy of the attack it is randomely decided if the attack lands and the attacked players health is decreased which updates the players health bar on screen. The game continues until there is only one player remaining who is declared the winner and is displayed on a congratulations screen. 

If I were to revisit this project I would like to add an "info" option to each attack in order to display it's accuracy and damage.
